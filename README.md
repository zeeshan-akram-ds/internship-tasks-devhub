# DevelopersHub Corporation — Data Science & Analytics Internship  
### Final Submission by **Zeeshan Akram**

## Internship Overview

This repository contains my complete work during the **Data Science & Analytics Internship** conducted by **DevelopersHub Corporation**.

Throughout this internship, I completed 5 practical projects covering various areas of Data Science and Machine Learning. My focus was on not only building effective models but also writing clean, understandable code, providing detailed analysis, and delivering professional-quality results.

## Projects Completed

| Task | Project Title                              | Deployment Status |
|------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1    | Iris Dataset Visualization & Exploration   | Not deployed (very basic exploratory task) |
| 2    | Credit Risk Prediction                     | ✅ Deployed via Streamlit |
| 3    | Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers) | ✅ Deployed via Streamlit |
| 4    | Insurance Charges Prediction               | ✅ Already deployed previously (link provided) |
| 5    | Loan Offer Acceptance Prediction           | ✅ Deployed via Streamlit |

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE and others)
- Streamlit (for app deployment)
- SHAP (Explainability visualizations)

---

## Modeling & Tuning Approach

- I trained **multiple models** for most tasks to benchmark results and choose the best-performing ones.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** was performed (mainly using Optuna) for XGBoost and other models.
- **Feature engineering** and preprocessing pipelines were designed carefully as per each task requirement.
- I ensured **data balancing** techniques (such as SMOTE) were used where needed.

---

## Data Analysis & Visualization

- I heavily focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** before modeling.
- Visual insights were presented clearly, with summary markdowns for each plot.
- Model evaluation was accompanied by:
    - Confusion Matrix
    - ROC Curve
    - Precision-Recall Curve
    - Classification Reports
    - SHAP Feature Importance (where applicable)

---

## Deployment

- I deployed **3 of the 5 projects** using **Streamlit** apps.
- For **Insurance Charges Prediction**, I have already deployed this project previously; I will provide the link to that deployed app in the submission.
- Deployment was done via **Streamlit Cloud** with clean and user-friendly UI.

## Deployed Applications

You can explore the following deployed Streamlit apps:

- **Task 2 - Credit Risk Prediction:** [https://internship-tasks-devapp-g39hkbw3oyeo6myr6ggpfg.streamlit.app/](https://internship-tasks-devapp-g39hkbw3oyeo6myr6ggpfg.streamlit.app/)

- **Task 3 - Customer Churn Prediction:** [https://internship-tasks-devapp-kern5bvbnbpf7qscyzqdkd.streamlit.app/](https://internship-tasks-devapp-kern5bvbnbpf7qscyzqdkd.streamlit.app/)

- **Task 5 - Bank Loan Offer Acceptance Prediction:** [https://internship-tasks-devapp-4mrc94edtksynutbcdmija.streamlit.app/](https://internship-tasks-devapp-4mrc94edtksynutbcdmija.streamlit.app/)

- **Task 4 - Insurance Charges Prediction:** [https://insurance-charges-model-hnnjayxdtcuqhpke6tl6hb.streamlit.app/](https://insurance-charges-model-hnnjayxdtcuqhpke6tl6hb.streamlit.app/)  
  _Note: The model, pipeline, and visualizations used here are the same as developed for Task 4 during this internship, so a new deployment was not required._

## Coding & Documentation

- The repository contains:
    - **Clean and commented code**
    - **Clear explanations** and insights after each major step
    - **Organized notebooks**
    - **Professional Streamlit apps** with guided inputs and visual outputs

---

## Final Remarks

I have put strong effort into ensuring that each task was performed with **professional quality**, not just minimum completion:

✅ Proper data cleaning  
✅ Modeling multiple approaches  
✅ Hyperparameter tuning  
✅ Balanced datasets where needed  
✅ Clear documentation and EDA  
✅ Streamlit deployment  
✅ Business-oriented insights

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this internship. It has been a highly valuable experience, and I look forward to applying these skills further in real-world projects.
