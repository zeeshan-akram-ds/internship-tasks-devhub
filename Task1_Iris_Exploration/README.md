# Task 1: Iris Dataset - Basic Exploration

## Objective
**Understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a dataset.**  
(Provided by: DevelopersHub Corporation, Data Science & Analytics Internship)

---

## Dataset
The famous **Iris Dataset**, a well-known benchmark dataset in data science, containing measurements of:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width  
along with species labels for **Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**.

This dataset is fully clean and requires no additional preprocessing.

## Approach

For this task, I performed basic but effective **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visually understand the relationships between features and species distribution.

### Visualizations Created:
âœ… **Scatter Plot:**  
- *Hue = Species*, *Style = Species*, *Size = 70*  
- Helped observe clear separability between some species.

âœ… **Histogram:**  
- Distribution of each feature across species (colored with hue).

âœ… **Boxplot:**  
- Feature value spread across species (colored with hue).  
- Helped observe median differences and feature variance.

### Additional Work:
- I provided **clear Markdown explanations** and **insightful observations** after each visualization.
- A final **Conclusion Section** summarizing the key patterns observed.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Seaborn** for beautiful, informative visualizations
- **Matplotlib** for enhanced plotting and control

---

## Deployment
Since this was a **very basic EDA task** (with no modeling or prediction), I chose not to deploy it as an app.  
Instead, the notebook demonstrates my ability to perform **clean, professional exploratory analysis**, document insights, and communicate findings effectively.

---

## Notes
- This is a classic beginner-level task, which I have worked on multiple times previously in various contexts.
- In this internship task, I focused on writing **clean code**, producing **clear visualizations**, and crafting **well-documented insights**, which are essential EDA skills.
