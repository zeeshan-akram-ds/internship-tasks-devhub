# Superstore Sales Dashboard

## Business Context & Overview

In any growing retail business, understanding performance across regions, customer segments, and product categories is crucial for making data-driven decisions. Executives and managers require real-time insights that go beyond traditional Excel reports â€” insights that answer *"Where are we making profit? Which customers drive revenue? Where are we losing money?"*.

This interactive dashboard serves as a powerful tool for business stakeholders to monitor operational performance, identify key revenue drivers, detect anomalies, and make actionable decisions â€” all in one place.

## Problem Statement

Retail businesses, especially those with global operations, struggle to:

* Monitor sales and profit trends across regions and segments
* Identify top-performing customers and products
* Understand segment-wise performance
* Detect underperformance or loss-making areas proactively
* Deliver consistent, shareable, and automated executive reports

Traditional BI tools like Excel are static, slow, and require manual effort to filter and analyze key insights. Stakeholders need something smarter, faster, and interactive.

## Objective

This dashboard is designed to:

* Provide a centralized view of all key performance metrics
* Enable on-the-fly filtering by Region, Category, Sub-Category, and Date
* Highlight actionable insights and business alerts automatically
* Offer customer-level drill-down analysis
* Deliver high-quality, downloadable PDF and CSV reports
* Allow email distribution of PDF reports in seconds

The goal is to replicate real-world BI capabilities in a lightweight, deployable format using Python and Streamlit, while keeping it intuitive for decision-makers.

## Dataset Description & Source

* **Dataset**: [Global Superstore sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apoorvaappz/global-super-store-dataset)
* **Source**: Provided by Developers Hub Internship Task
* **Records**: Over 50,000 sales transactions across multiple countries
* **Fields**: Region, Category, Sub-Category, Customer, Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity, Segment, City, Date, etc.

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Performed in a separate Jupyter Notebook to keep `app.py` clean and performant.

### Summary of Cleaning Steps Performed

* Loaded dataset using appropriate encoding (`ISO-8859-1`)
* Dropped irrelevant columns
* Removed duplicates
* Handled missing values smartly
* Parsed 'Order Date' into datetime format
* Converted main columns (`Sales`, `Profit`, etc.) to `float`/`int`
* Extracted new time-based features (`Month`, `Year`, `Weekday`)
* Created additional features:

  * `Sales_per_Quantity`
  * `Profit_per_Sale`
  * `Is_Profitable`
* Verified final shape and saved as a clean CSV for dashboard use

This step ensures the dataset is optimized and ready for interactive BI dashboard development in Streamlit.
