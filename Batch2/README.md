## 🧠 Internship Summary

This repository contains the final submission of my 3 selected projects for Batch 2 of the Data Science & Analytics Internship organized by DevelopersHub Corporation.

Each project focuses on a different area of data science — from unsupervised learning and time series forecasting to real-world business intelligence dashboards. I prioritized clean code, business impact, insightful analysis, and deployable apps or reports throughout all tasks.

## 📁 Projects Included

| Task | Project Title | Category | Deployment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning | Clustering, Business Strategy | ✅ Deployed via Streamlit |
| 4 | Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting | Time Series, Forecasting | ❌ Jupyter Notebook |
| 5 | Superstore Sales Dashboard | Business Intelligence, Reporting | ✅ Deployed via Streamlit |

## 🔍 Project Overviews

### 🧩 Task 2 – Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

A practical unsupervised learning project to cluster mall customers into actionable marketing segments based on age, income, and spending habits using K-Means clustering and t-SNE.

**Key Features**:

* Clear EDA & customer insights
* K-Means clustering (optimal K = 5 via Elbow Method)
* t-SNE visualization for cluster clarity
* Segment naming: Premium Spenders, Cautious Elites, etc.
* 📄 PDF report generator with segment-level strategy
* ✅ Deployed interactive Streamlit app

**Live App**: [Customer Segmentation Dashboard](https://internship-tasks-devapp-juqrcrzfphz8a3ihfmwwdj.streamlit.app/)

### ⚡ Task 4 – Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

A deep dive into forecasting short-term energy usage using a household power consumption dataset. This project explores temporal patterns and compares multiple models.

**Key Features**:

* Full data cleaning, time-based feature engineering
* Seasonality, trend & pattern analysis (daily, weekly, yearly)
* Models used: ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, XGBoost
* Evaluation via MAE, RMSE, MAPE
* Visual comparison of predictions vs. actual usage
* 📈 **XGBoost & Prophet outperformed ARIMA due to non-linear pattern handling**

**Notebook Included**: `energy_forecasting.ipynb`
**Dataset Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)

### 📊 Task 5 – Superstore Sales Dashboard (BI App)

A full-fledged Business Intelligence dashboard created using Streamlit to provide real-time executive insights from Superstore sales data.

**Key Features**:

* Executive KPIs (Sales, Profit, Orders, Customers)
* Real-time filtering by Region, Segment, Date, Category
* 📈 Charts: Line trends, pie charts, grouped bars, segment KPIs
* 📥 PDF & CSV exports
* 🔔 Business alerts (e.g., profit drops, sales outliers)
* 📧 Email-ready report delivery built in
* 🤖 Auto-generated business narratives
* ✅ Deployed Streamlit dashboard

**Live App**: [Superstore BI Dashboard](https://internship-tasks-devapp-qbezt4qddwcbj4y5qwewjs.streamlit.app/)
**Demo Video & Report**: Available inside the app interface

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

**Languages**: Python

**Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, FPDF, XGBoost, Prophet

**Apps**: Streamlit

**Others**: SHAP (explainability), t-SNE (dimensionality reduction), SMTP (email integration)

## 💡 Highlights

* Clean, modular, and commented code for all projects
* Strong focus on business relevance and interpretability
* Streamlit dashboards that are deployable, shareable, and visually clear
* PDF report generation and segment strategy in clustering project
* BI dashboard mimicking real-world executive tools
* Data science workbench includes EDA, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and deployment

## 🙌 Final Note

This internship was an excellent opportunity to simulate real-world business problems, apply end-to-end data science skills, and deliver actionable, user-facing applications. Each project was crafted not only with technical rigor but also with business storytelling in mind.

I am confident in carrying these skills forward into impactful data projects in the future.
